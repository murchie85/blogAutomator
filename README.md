# Automated HTML Page Creator

This project is a Python script that automates the creation of HTML pages. The script uses a predefined template, injects custom content at specific placeholders, and writes the resulting content to a new file.


## Stretch goal 

To do tech blog summaries with GPT engines but keep a human in a loop. It builds html, makes up url, title etc. I do summariser and final touches with images. 


## Usage

1. Update the `values.txt` file with the required variables. Each line should contain the following information, in the following order:

PROJECTTITLE
URLTITLE
IMAGEPATH
BLOGDESCRIPTION
INLINETITLE
PAGENAME
MAINCONTENT


- `PROJECTTITLE`: The title of the project.
- `URLTITLE`: The title to be used in the URL.
- `IMAGEPATH`: The path to the image to be used.
- `BLOGDESCRIPTION`: A brief description of the blog.
- `INLINETITLE`: The title that appears in line with the content.
- `PAGENAME`: The name of the output HTML file.
- `MAINCONTENT`: The main content of the page. This should be valid HTML markup. Note that the markup should only include the `<body>` element and its contents, excluding the `<html>` or `<head>` elements as they will already be in the template.

The `DATE` and `BACKGROUNDIMAGE` variables are auto-generated by the script.

2. Run the script using the command `python3 your_script_name.py` (replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script). The script will read the content from the `values.txt` file, replace the placeholders in the template with the respective values, and write the resulting content to a new file named after the `PAGENAME` value.

3. Check the directory containing the template file for a new HTML file with the name you specified in the `PAGENAME` line of the `values.txt` file.

## Notes

The script uses a random background image, chosen from a range of 18 options (bg1 to bg18). The date is automatically generated based on the current date.
